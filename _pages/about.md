Hello all! I'm Justice.

I started my career as an industrial engineer, working in warehouse automation, where I specialized in PLC programming, electrical design, network layouts, and system commissioning. My year was a cycle of designing control schematics, traveling on-site to install and program warehouse systems, and wrapping up with documentation and support.

After spending long hours commissioning these systems, I realized that software was the futureâ€”and I wanted to be part of it. So, I made the leap, teaching myself to code and transitioning into software development. Now, I'm a self-taught developer with a passion for continuous learning and problem-solving. Excited to see where the journey takes me next!
